### Want to contribute?
Great! But first you'll need to:

1. Set up a local MySQL/MariaDB database.
2. Have Spigot downloaded and set up
3. Compile PCBridge into a .jar and place it in the plugins/ folder
4. Run the server once to generate the config file (config.yml)
5. Add your database connection details into the config file

Be sure to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/andimage/PCBridge/wiki/Contributing) on how PCBridge works.

### Dependencies
PCBridge uses Maven to shade dependencies into the final JAR file.
